=head1 NAME

DBIx::QueryByName - Execute SQL queries by name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::QueryByName allows you to decouple SQL code from Perl code
by replacing inline SQL queries with method calls.

The idea is to write the code of your SQL queries somewhere else than
in your perl code (in a XML file for example) and let
DBIx::QueryByName load those SQL declarations and generate methods to
execute each query as a usual object method call.

This module also implements automatic database session recovery and
query retry, when it is deemed safe to do so. It was specifically
designed to be used as a high availability interface against a cluster
of replicated postgres databases running behind one service IP.

DBIx::QueryByName can manage multiple database connections and is fork
safe.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::QueryByName;

    my $dbh = DBIx::QueryByName->new();

    # define 2 database connections
    $dbh->connect("db1", "dbi:Pg:dbname=mydb;host=127.0.0.1;port=6666", $username, $password);
    $dbh->connect("db2", "dbi:SQLite:/path/to/db/file");

    # load some default queries to run against db1
    my $queries = <<__ENDQ__;
    <queries>
        <query name="add_job" params="id,username,description">INSERT INTO jobs (id, username, description, status) VALUES (?,?,?,0)</query>
        <query name="get_job_count" params="">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs</query>
    </queries>
    __ENDQ__

    $dbh->load(session => 'db1', from_xml => $queries);

    # load some default queries to run against db2, from an xml file
    $dbh->load(session => 'db1', from_xml_file => $filepath);

    # now run some queries:

    # insert a few rows in db1.jobs
    $dbh->add_job( { id => 12,
                     username => "tom",
                     description => "catch mouse" } );
    $dbh->add_job( { id => 13,
                     username => "jerry",
                     description => "run away from cat" } );

    # count the number of rows:
    my $sth = $dbh->get_job_count();

    # then do what you usually do with a statement handler...

=head1 SESSION MANAGEMENT AND FORK SAFETY

DBIx::QueryByName opens one database connection for every process that
needs to execute a query over a given session (as declared in
C<load()>) and for every child process of that process.

A rollback or commit (or any other database method) therefore only
affects the connection associated with the running process (defined by
its pid C<$$>) and not the connections to the same database openened
for the process's children or parents.

Notice that fork safety has been tested against Postgres databases
only. We cannot guarantee that it works with other databases :)

=head1 AUTOMATED RECOVERY

If a database connection gets interupted or closed, and the reason for
the interuption is that the database server is closing down or is not
reachable, DBIx::QueryByName will transparently try to reconnect to
the database until it succeeds and re-execute the query. Note that
this only works when you call a query by its name. Calls to C<query>,
C<begin_work>, C<commit>, C<rollback> are only aliases to the
corresponding DBI calls and will fail in the same way.

Any other connection or execution failure will still result in a
die/croak that you will have to catch and handle from within your
application.

=head1 SUPPORTED DATABASES

DBIx::QueryByName has been tested thoroughly against postgres. We
cannot guarrantee that it will work with other databases (but it
should :). A database is supported if it provides standard error
messages (see QueryByName.pm::AUTOLOAD) and support the DBI parameter
InactiveDestroy.

=head1 LOGGING

DBIx::QueryByName logs via Log::Log4perl if it is available. If
Log::Log4perl is available but not configured, you may see warnings
poping up. Just configure a default logger in Log::Log4perl to get rid
of them.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over 4

=item C<< $dbh = DBIx::QueryByName->new(); >>

Return an instance of DBIx::QueryByName.

=item C<< $dbh->connect($session_name, @dbi_connection_params); >>

Declare how to open (later on) a database connection called
C<$session_name> with the provided standard DBI connection
parameters. Actually opening the connection is defered until needed,
that is until one of query(), quote(), begin_work(), rollback() or
commit() is called or any of the named queries loaded for this
session.

Example:
    $dbh->connect('db',"dbi:Pg:dbname=$db;host=$host;port=$port", $username, $password, {pg_enable_utf8 => 1});

=item C<< $dbh->load(session => $session_name, from_xml_file => $file); >>

or

=item C<< $dbh->load(session => $session_name, from_xml => $string); >>

Load SQL queries from the xml query file C<$queryfile> or the string
C<$string>. Afterward, to execute those queries just call the method
of the same name on C<$dbh>. This method will automatically execute
the corresponding query over the database connection C<$session_name>.

=item C<< $dbh->load(session => $session_name, from_pg => 1); >>

NOT IMPLEMENTED YET! Autoload named queries to call all stored
procedures declared in a postgres database to whom we can connect
using C<$session_name>.

=item C<< $dbh->$your_query_name( ) >>

or

=item C<< $dbh->$your_query_name( {param1 => value1, param2 => value2...} ) >>

or

=item C<< $dbh->$your_query_name( \%values1, \%values2, \%values3... ) >>

Once you have specified how to connect to the database with
C<connect()> and loaded some named queries with C<load()>, you can
execute any of the sql queries by its name as a method of C<$dbh>.


Both single execution and bulk execution are supported. 


If the query has no sql parameters, just call the query's method without
parameters. Example:

    $dbh->increase_counter( );

If the query accept a values to bind to sql parameters, pass those
values as an anonymous hash in which keys are the names of sql
parameters and values are their values. Example:

    $dbh->add_book( { author => 'me',
                      title => 'my life',
                      isbn => $blabla,
                    } );

If the query allows it, you may perform bulk execution and
execute multiple parameter hashes at once. This is done by
calling DBI's execute_array method. Example:

    # insert 2 books at once (or more)
    $dbh->add_book( { author => 'me',
                      title => 'my life',
                      isbn => $blabla,
                    },
                    { author => 'you',
                      title => 'your life',
                      isbn => $moreblabla,
                    },
                  );

=back

The following methods are just aliases for the corresponding DBI
methods. Do not use them if you don't really have to as some might be
removed in a later version of this module.

=over 4

=item C<< $dbh->rollback($session_name); >>

Perform a rollback on the session named C<$session_name> and return
its result.

=item C<< $dbh->commit(); >>

Perform a commit on the session named C<$session_name> and return its
result.

=item C<< $dbh->begin_work(); >>

Call the DBI begin_work() method on the session named
C<$session_name> and return its result.

=item C<< $dbh->quote($session_name, $string); >>

Call DBI's quote() method on C<$string> for the database handler
associated with C<$session_name> and return its result. WARNING: this
method might be removed from later versions as it is outside the core
scope of this module. Use at your own risk.

=item C<< my $sth = $dbh->query($session_name,$sql); >>

Call prepare and execute for this SQL. Return the executed statement
handler. WARNING: this method might be removed from later versions as
it only provides a backdoor to the querying-by-name mechanism. Use at
your own risk.

=back

=head1 XML FILE SYNTAX

When calling load() with C<from_xml> or C<from_xml_file>, the XML
string expected must have the following format:

    <queries>
        <query name="{query's name}"
               params="{names of the sql's placeholders, as a comma-separated and in order of appearance}">
        {some sql code with placeholders}</query>
        <query ...>...</query>
        <query ...>...</query>
        <query ...>...</query>
        ...
    </queries>

Always use placeholders ('?' signs) in your SQL!

=head1 DEBUGGING

To see all the gutwork happening on stderr, set the environment
variable DBIXQUERYBYNAMEDEBUG to 1.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

=head2 Forked processes not calling queries

If a process opens one or more database connections and forks, but
it's child opens no database connection of its own, the connections of
the parent will be closed without respect to InactiveDestroy when the
child exits. To avoid troubles, always commit data explicitely.

=head2 Execute does not timeout

In some cases, a call to DBI's execute method (or ping) may hang
forever. This may happen if you loose contact with the server during
an operation. DBIx::QueryByName does no attempt at making execute to
timeout. This is a design decision.

The only alternative would be to implement a eval/die/alarm block
around the execute call but that would require to run perl with
unsafe signal handling, which the authors declined to do.

For an example of how to implement such an eval/die/alarm block,
see the source for SthPool.pm.

DBIx::NamedQuery: almost the same but doesn't support named
parameters, forks and multiple simultaneous database connections.
